Learning was very challeging since the thinking process is different from what I was used to, but after it <em>clicks</em> it was interesting to use!</p><h3>one[s]tap</h3><p>Identity application, the idea was an app that you could use to authenticate in various physical/virtual places that needed your Brazilian id, driver's license or any other document.</p><p>I made the application from the ground up using MVP, submodules so we could disengage parts of the application and make it easier for other developers incorporate our SDK on their applications.</p><p>It also had a lot of unit and UI tests using XCTests framework.</p><h3>SDKs</h3><p>All three apps were made thinking on reusability and provided help to our clients with some SDKs.</p><h3>CI and CD with Bitrise and other technologies</h3><p>All the applications used CI and CD with Bitrise and Fastlane to help build, test and generate new versions for the App Store.</p><h3>Back-end development with C#/.NET</h3><p>When I was working on one[s]tap application, I made a API focused on the front-end. It returned data to model the views dynamically.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="https://twitter.com/munirwanis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></p><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
