For me, develop apps is fun and challenging, rather I'm working alone or with a group of people it's always essential to develop abstract and reusable code for maximum performance and quick application growth.</p><p>In my free time I love to create music, play videogames and work on my personal projects where I am free to experiment the newest technologies that may not be stable enough to work on big applications.</p><h2>Work Experience</h2><ul class="about-list"><li><article><h1>Independent iOS Developer</h1><div>Self-employed<br/>Feb 2019 - Present</div><ul class="tag-list"></ul><div><p>In my available time I try to to put my ideas to work, forcing myself to learn new technologies and when the MVP is finished and looks interesting I put it on the App Store. I also do freelancing jobs.</p><p>Currently I have two applications on the Apple Store:</p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/br/app/daily-luck/id1466734948?l=en" target="_blank">Daily Luck</a></h3><p>A daily motivational phrase app that shows the user everyday one new phrase, the user can see all the previous unlocked phrases and is notified when a new phrase is available.</p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/br/app/magiply/id1500523599?l=en" target="_blank">Magiply</a></h3><p>A very simple game for children to train multiplications, it uses animal pictures and some animations and transitions.</p><hr/><p>All the apps for iOS that I am doing are in SwiftUI, Apple's new layout framework.</p><p>I also created apps for macOS that helps me on the day-to-day maintenance of Daily Luck and other future apps.</p></div></article></li><li><article><h1>Stone Co.</h1><div>iOS Developer<br/>Jun 2017 - May 2020</div><ul class="tag-list"></ul><div><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stone-portal/id1196425762" target="_blank">Portal application</a></h3><p>An app for Stone Co. costumers see how they are performing with their sales, requests POS machines, etc.</p><p>Maintained and expanded the app, created a solution to handle application loading/error/success states with ease, fixed bugs and created features.</p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/br/app/conta-stone/id1438680035?l=en" target="_blank">Conta Stone</a></h3><p>I started working on early development of the app so I helped define the base application, reusable views, architecture (MVVM-C), etc.</p><p>It was my first experience with reactive programming using RxSwift, it managed the states of each views with very less code. Learning was very challeging since the thinking process is different from what I was used to, but after it <em>clicks</em> it was interesting to use!</p><h3>one[s]tap</h3><p>Identity application, the idea was an app that you could use to authenticate in various physical/virtual places that needed your Brazilian id, driver's license or any other document.</p><p>I made the application from the ground up using MVP, submodules so we could disengage parts of the application and make it easier for other developers incorporate our SDK on their applications.</p><p>It also had a lot of unit and UI tests using XCTests framework.</p><h3>SDKs</h3><p>All three apps were made thinking on reusability and provided help to our clients with some SDKs.</p><h3>CI and CD with Bitrise and other technologies</h3><p>All the applications used CI and CD with Bitrise and Fastlane to help build, test and generate new versions for the App Store.</p><h3>Back-end development with C#/.NET</h3><p>When I was working on one[s]tap application, I made a API focused on the front-end. It returned data to model the views dynamically.</p></div></article></li><li><article><h1>Mundipagg</h1><div>Software Developer<br/>Jun 2015 - Aug 2017</div><ul class="tag-list"></ul><div><p><a href="https://github.com/mundipagg/boleto-api" target="_blank">Created a open source Golang API</a> that register and create Boletos.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/mundipagg/goseq" target="_blank">Created a open source Golang SDK</a> to support SEQ logs.</p><p>Developed and maintained other internal APIs and WCF services using .NET/C# and created bots with WCF to make our internal work more automated.</p><p>Developed and maintained the core API (.NET/C#) of the company.
